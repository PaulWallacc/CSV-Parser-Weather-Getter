This is a simple project I have been working on that pulls the maximum and minimum temperatures from the Weather.gov website. The reason I have named it CSV Parser is because the program parses a csv file that has the longitude and latitudeof world cities. The Program allows you to enter a city. Based on the city entered the program will either tell you the weather in that city or throw an error.
